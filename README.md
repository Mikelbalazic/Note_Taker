# Note_Taker

In this challenge, users are presented with an application that allows them to write, save and delete notes for daily remembrance and organization. Utilizing front-end and back-end javascript, express, node, and routing, the application is able to save the user's notes not in local storage, but in JSON format so that the notes will always be available until the user deletes the notes themselves. 

The information provided by the user is stored in a db.json file in an array and the actual words of the notes that are saved can be seen inside the file.

The notes are created and deleted by utilizing the id syntax so that the code can locate the exact note that the user is interacting with, adjust according to the users input, and save/delete the notes accordingly.

This application was very important for understanding how the full stack environment interacts with one another and illustrates a full circle of the communication between files and directories. 

Overall, I am satisfied with how my logic encompasses the principles of Express.js and the beginnings of a full stack application.
